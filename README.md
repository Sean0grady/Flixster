# Flixster
First major assignment of the semester foer 388. This project helped to gain familiarity using API's. The process for aquiring an API key and 
then using our methods to request data from the API URL and parse it to our app so we can display something meaningful to our user. The recyclerView was
also given more depth and it's functionality was explored to a greater degree.
